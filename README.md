# Google Store App Rating Prediction



## Problem Statement

CONTEXT:
The Play Store apps data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success. However, many apps
are being developed every single day and only a few of them become profitable. It is important for developers to be
able to predict the success of their app and incorporate features which makes an app successful. We can collect app
data and user ratings from the app stores and use it to extract insightful information. A machine learning model can be
used to predict rating for a given app, which can be used to estimate success and scope of improvement.
